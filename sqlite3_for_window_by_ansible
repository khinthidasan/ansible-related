#If you are working with window and do not want to install sqlite3 permanently 
#( in my case, I just want to update some table fields of *.db sqlite file stored in window, do not want to install sqlite3 at the window),
#I downloaded sqlite3.exe and copy to window to execute my ansible. After that sqlite3 is deleted from window.
